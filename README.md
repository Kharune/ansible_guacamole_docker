        ansible_python_interpreter: auto_silent
      hosts:
        192.168.253.130:22450  # Change this based on your environment
    preprod:
      children:
        lab:

Playbook Configuration (PB_deploy_guacamole.yml)

    ---
    - name: Deploy Guacamole with HAProxy & SSL
      hosts: preprod  # Change this based on your target group
      remote_user: control  # Change this based on your user
      become: true
      roles:
        - guacamole_docker_with_https

Ansible Configuration (ansible.cfg)

Ensure your Ansible configuration is set correctly :

    [defaults]
    inventory=/home/control/ansible_guacamole_docker/hosts.yml  # Change to your inventory file
    transport=paramiko  # Change if you don't use paramiko

Run the playbook :

    ansible-playbook PB_deploy_guacamole.yml

‚öôÔ∏è **Role Variables**

Customize the role variables by modifying defaults/main.yml :

    # Database Configuration
    mysql_root_password: "your_password"
    mysql_database: "guacamole"
    mysql_user: "guacamole"
    mysql_password: "your_password"
    
    # SSL Configuration
    fqdn: "guacamole.example.com"
    ssl_cert_path: "/etc/ssl/certs/guacamole.pem"
    ssl_key_path: "/etc/ssl/private/guacamole.key"

Override variables in your playbook if needed :

    - name: Deploy Guacamole with Custom Settings
      hosts: preprod
      roles:
        - role: guacamole_docker
          vars:
            fqdn: "remote.example.com"
            mysql_password: "securepassword"

üîí **SSL & HAProxy Configuration**

Self-Signed Certificate Generation

This role automatically generates a self-signed SSL certificate for HAProxy :

    Certificate Path: /etc/ssl/certs/guacamole.pem
    
    Key Path: /etc/ssl/private/guacamole.key

To use a Let's Encrypt certificate instead :

    Replace the generated certificate with a valid Let's Encrypt cert.
    
    Update the HAProxy configuration to point to the new certificate paths.

    File : HAProxy Configuration (haproxy.cfg.j2)

This role configures HAProxy to :

    Terminate SSL at the proxy
    
    Forward traffic to Guacamole
    
    Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
